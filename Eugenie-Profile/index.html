    <p>I am curious and I like to discover the different aspects of the world, especially while traveling. 🌍I enjoy spending time with my family, helping others and participating in projects. Thus, I created an association to help people called "Chers voisins"  🤝</p>

<p> I am passionate about <strong>Athletism. </strong> I have been doing it for 9 years. I participated in many competitions, including the 100m and the 1500m.
This sport has taught me motivation, self-defense and endurance. These skills have helped me in many areas, including school, and have allowed me to push myself to achieve my goals. Beyond that, it is an activity that allows me to recharge my batteries, when I arrive at a training session, I forget about all the external problems. It is for me the most beautiful sport that exists. Moreover, it combines individualism and collective, with individual performances but also a group spirit to defend the colors of his club.

<p> I really like <strong>Meditate and work on myself.</strong>
Unlike athletics, meditation is an activity that I have been doing for a short time. Indeed, I am a very anxious person, I have been having anxiety attacks regularly for 4 years. I have seen many psychologists but it never worked. So I tried sophrology and it helped me a lot. It is a medical technique based on breathing exercises and control of emotions. So I started, even outside of my sessions, to meditate at home and to learn to breathe. Because breathing .... can be learned.

I love <strong>sailing </strong>since I was a little girl. Sailing is a sport that requires a lot of patience, attention and discipline. One mistake and the boat turns over. I didn't love this activity right away because of all the first times I ended up in the water when I was only 6 years old... But the more I grew, the more I fell, the more I realized that this sport was incredible. I did 1 or 2 months, every summer, in the bay of La Baule. Two years ago I even passed my level 3 and became an assistant instructor. I would like to become an instructor in one or two years.</p>
